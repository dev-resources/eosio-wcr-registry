## Name: Missing Assertion Check

### Unique Identifier: EOSIO-WCR-104

### Vulnerability Rating: Low

### Relationship: [CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)

## Background

There are going to be assumptions which will require assertions while execution of the contract. Using eosio_assert will take care of the conditions beforehand and stop the execution of the specific action if the assertions fails.

### Summary

The assert statement above makes an assumption that roll_under integer is greater than 2 & less than 96. But if it doesnâ€™t, throw the above message and stop the execution. Failing to discover corner cases like the above could become catastrophic for the house setting the rules.

## Vulnerability

### Sample Code 

```c++
void token::transfer( account_name from, account_name to, asset quantity)
{
    void assert_roll_under(const uint8_t& roll_under) 
    {
        eosio_assert(roll_under >= 2 && roll_under <= 96,
                "roll under overflow, must be greater than 2 and less than 96");
    }
}
```
