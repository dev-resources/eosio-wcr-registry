## Name: Missing Assertion Check

### Unique Identifier: EOSIO-WCR-104

### Vulnerability Rating: Medium

### Relationship: [CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)

## Background

**eosio.assert** roots from the EOSIO Assert Contract which is a security feature made to reduce the need for users to trust blockchain apps when a user signs a transaction for a trusted blockchain network with a trusted wallet application

### Summary

Smart contracts rely on a set of assumptions which require assertions to be met before users or external contracts are allowed to execute actions. Failure to use **eosio_assert** will mean the conditions required beforehand will be bypassed and be powerless to stop the execution of the specific action if the assertions fails

<br/>

## Vulnerability

### Sample Code 

The assert statement in the sample code below makes an assumption that **roll_under** integer is greater than 2 and less than 96. But if it doesnâ€™t, throw the above message and stop the execution. Failing to discover corner cases like the above could become catastrophic for the house setting the rules.

```c++
void token::transfer( account_name from, account_name to, asset quantity)
{
    void assert_roll_under(const uint8_t& roll_under) 
    {
        eosio_assert(roll_under >= 2 && roll_under <= 96,
                "roll under overflow, must be greater than 2 and less than 96");
    }
}
```
